### Research Questions to Answer:
1.	Does the poverty rate correlate to graduation rate?
2.	Does household size correlate to graduation rate?
3.	Does the unemployment rate correlate to graduation rate?
4. 	Does the median income correlate to graduation rate?
5.	Does the language spoken at home affect graduation rates?


### Data Sets to be Used: 

Census API

Various NJDOE Data Sets available at: https://www.state.nj.us/education/data/

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
One person will need to clean the data so that it is only the high schools’ graduation rate and test scores.Each person will select one question to answer. We will all use the cleaned data.

We will compile our code and work on the presentation together.
