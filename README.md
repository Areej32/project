### Project Description/Outline:
How do various different factors affect New Jersey’s high school’s graduation rate and standardized test scores. 

### Research Questions to Answer:
1.	Does level of income correlate to graduation rate and test scores?
2.	Does household size correlate to graduation rate and test scores?
3.	Does unemployment rate correlate to graduation rate and test scores?
4.	Does the type of town (rural, urban, or suburban) affect graduation rate and test scores?
5.	Does the demography of a district correlate to graduation rate and test scores? 
6.	Does the type of school (private, public, military) affect the graduation rate and test scores?
7.	Does spending per pupil correlate to graduation rate and test scores?
8.	Does the language spoken at home correlate to graduation rate and test scores?

### Data Sets to be Used: 

Census API

Various NJDOE Data Sets available at: https://www.state.nj.us/education/data/

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
One person will need to clean the data so that it is only the high schools’ graduation rate and test scores.Each person will select one question to answer. We will all use the cleaned data.

We will compile our code and work on the presentation together.
